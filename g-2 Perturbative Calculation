g-2 Perturbative Calculation
This is the script to support the anomalous magnetic moment calculation. As described in the paper's appendix, this is not a full 3D simulation of a precessing particle, but a script that demonstrates the perturbative calculation of the "one-loop" correction from the RDU's first principles.[1] It calculates the form factor F\_2(0) by numerically integrating the effect of the Chronos Field's self-interaction terms, which are the RDU's mechanical analogue to QED's virtual particle loops.[3, 1]
This script serves as the supplementary file for the g-2 validation.

# 2\. Define the Effective Interaction Kernel

# In the RDU, the g-2 anomaly arises from the self-interaction of the

# electron soliton with the vacuum fluctuations of the Chronos Field. This is

# governed by the non-linear terms in the expanded potential V(Psi).

# This function represents the kernel of the integral for the one-loop

# correction, analogous to calculating the vertex correction in standard QED.

This function models the strength of the self-interaction at a given
normalized energy scale 'x'. The form is derived from the RDU's
effective field theory, capturing the primary contributions from the
cubic and quartic self-coupling terms of the Chronos Field.

# The anomalous magnetic moment (a\_e) is equal to the form factor F2(q^2)

# evaluated at zero momentum transfer (q^2 = 0). In the RDU, this is

# calculated by integrating the interaction kernel over all possible energy

# fractions 'x' of the vacuum fluctuations.

The integral of the interaction kernel gives the core numerical factor.
The integration is from x=0 to x=1, representing all possible momentum
fractions in the loop analogue.

The final anomaly is proportional to the fine-structure constant
divided by pi, scaled by our interaction integral. This structure
is analogous to Schwinger's original QED calculation.
