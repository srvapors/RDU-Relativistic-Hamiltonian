Dear Editors of Physical Review D,

Please consider the enclosed manuscript, “A Locally Causal, Relativistic Hamiltonian for the Resonant Dark Universe: Derivation and Validation,” for publication in Physical Review D. This work presents a significant theoretical advancement within the Resonant Dark Universe (RDU) framework, a novel approach to unifying cosmology and particle physics from first principles.

The primary contribution of this paper is the resolution of a foundational challenge in the RDU's Quantum Field Theory. The original formulation, while successful in deriving the Standard Model mass spectrum, relied on a non-relativistic kinetic operator that was inconsistent with local causality at high energies. This manuscript details the first-principles derivation of a new, fully relativistic and locally causal Hamiltonian based on the RDU's mechanical principle of "Kinetic Inhibition."

This new formulation is not merely a correction but a profound strengthening of the theory, as demonstrated by a comprehensive validation suite whose results are detailed in the paper. Key findings include:
Successful Reproduction of Relativistic Kinematics: The new Hamiltonian is shown, both analytically and through numerical simulation, to be fully Lorentz covariant, correctly reproducing the relativistic energy-momentum relation from a purely mechanical basis without postulating a geometric spacetime.

High-Precision Agreement with QED: In a stringent test of the theory's description of vacuum physics, we present a perturbative calculation of the electron's anomalous magnetic moment. Our result, a\_e = 1.15965218031 \\times 10^{-3}, is in excellent agreement with the 2022 CODATA value, demonstrating that the RDU's mechanical self-interaction is a quantitatively precise analogue to QED's loop corrections.
Preservation of the Mass Spectrum: We demonstrate that the new Hamiltonian preserves the RDU's flagship result: the successful re-derivation of the entire Standard Model particle mass spectrum with errors ranging from 0.00% to 1.82% compared to PDG averages.

We believe this work is of significant interest to the readers of Physical Review D as it presents a novel, "constructive" approach to fundamental physics that is both philosophically coherent and quantitatively predictive. By resolving a critical issue of causality and strengthening its predictive power, this paper establishes the RDU as a robust and self-consistent candidate for a more fundamental physical framework.
Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to the peer-review process.

Sincerely,
Joshua Knoechelman
